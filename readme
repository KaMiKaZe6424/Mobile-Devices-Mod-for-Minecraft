This is the source-code of my Mobile Devices mod.

To edit and recompile this code, you need to download the minecraft forge source package,
and move the main folder into the src folder of the previously downloaded
forge development evironment.

In the '~/src/lib' folder there are one ore more apis and libraries.
These are required by my mod and need to be in the classpath of the
eclipse project. To add these to the gradle builder, you need to add
the following lines to the bottom of the build.gradle file:
    
    dependencies {
        compile files('src/lib/snakeyaml-1.11.jar')
    }
